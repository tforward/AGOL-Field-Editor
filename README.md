Q: When I view the raw JSON it’s all compacted, aka Minified.

A: Use an online JSON Beautifier to change this, like this one [JSONFormatter](https://jsonformatter.org/)

## Notes
* This tool has no affiliation with ESRI
* This tool applies rules to all fields with the same fieldname. For example if you have three layers with the fieldname “TYPE” it will apply the rules across all of them. For editing this detailed level of manually edit the JSON file after you’ve made the changes with this tool first.
